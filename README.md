Whiting Turner VR Safety Simulation
The Whiting Turner VR Safety Simulation is a project developed by Florida Polytechnic University in collaboration with Whiting Turner Construction Co. It is designed to provide a realistic virtual reality (VR) training platform for enhancing worksite safety practices in the construction industry.

Overview
The VR safety simulation platform offers an immersive experience that allows Whiting Turner employees to practice safety protocols and hazard identification in a virtual construction environment. By leveraging the power of VR technology, this project aims to improve safety awareness and preparedness among employees.

Key Features
Construction Site Environments: The VR simulation includes various construction site environments, carefully tailored to match real-life Whiting Turner construction sites. These environments offer a realistic training experience.
Hazard Identification: The platform incorporates a tag system that enables employees to interact with objects tagged as hazards. When an employee interacts with a hazardous object, they can access a menu to identify the specific type of hazard. This feature enhances realism and promotes accurate hazard recognition.
Future Development Flexibility: The tag system implemented in the platform allows for potential future developments and expansions. It serves as a foundation for incorporating additional behaviors and interactions between employees and objects in the VR environment.
Performance Metrics and Progress Tracking: The platform includes a profile system that allows employees to save their progress and track performance metrics. Metrics such as time taken to complete tasks and accuracy percentages in hazard identification are recorded. This feature enables employees to monitor their improvements over time and personalize their training experiences.
